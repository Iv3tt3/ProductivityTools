# Call Center MP3 Downloader
This script downloads MP3 files from a list of specified URLs and saves them as audio.mp3 files in the current directory.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this script is to solve the issue of storing customer call recordings from a call center on the company's own server.

### The Problem:
A company had a call center integrated with a CRM system. The call recordings were stored on the call center’s server, but they were automatically deleted after six months. As a result, the URLs provided by the CRM to access these recordings became unavailable.

### The Solution:
The company needed a way to save the call recordings before they were deleted. This script was developed to automate the download of all MP3 files from a list of URLs provided by the CRM, ensuring that the recordings were safely stored on the company’s own server.
